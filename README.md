# FilmOfTheWeek

*The website corresponding to this project is [here](http://www.film.helene-p.fr/)*

The website is a flask app, and every new monday it picks a movie from the initial list randomly.

This movie is then removed from the list, the current.txt file is updated with the title of this
new movie and the seen.txt is updated with the date of the pick.

It's quite a simple code, but the plan is to later redo it in javascript, once i will know more
about this language !
